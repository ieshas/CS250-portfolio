**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

User stories point out a user need in a clear and concise way.  It is broken in to 3 sections: identifying the user, stating their need, and why this need is useful to them. User stories creates a clear problem for the developer to solve. The developers are then able to create features without any guessing on what is to be delivered.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach developing programs by:
1. Recognizing the problems needed to be solved
2. Breaking each problem down to actionable goals
3. Prioritizing each goal by importance and size

I hope the incoporate the focus of being flexible. I think that is the biggest advantage the agile method has over the waterfall method.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

You’re all here to achieve the same goal so it doesn't make any sense to be a bad team member. Open communication and trust go such a long way. Making sure the whole team is on the same page so no one is left behind. Being honest without being condescending or rude. These small qualities are vital to a teams success.
